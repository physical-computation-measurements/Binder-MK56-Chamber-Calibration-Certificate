# Binder MK56 Thermal Chamber Calibration Certificate

This repository contains a PDF copy of the calibration certificate for the thermal chamber in the Physical Computation laboratory. 

The thermal chamber is pictured below:

The key information from the calibration certificate is that the thermal chamber was measured to have an absolute temperature uncertainty of 0.2 K or less
(which is well within the specification of 0.5 K) using one temperature measurement at 20.6 degrees Celsius at one point inside the chamber. 

The reference standard used for the calibration had a measurement uncertainty of 0.15 K.
